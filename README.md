# Helper scripts

A simpler way to stop me forgetting how to add scripts to my path.

Requires ZSH.

`./setup.sh && source ~/.zshrc` to add this project to PATH and export SCRIPTS_PATH variable

`sls` displays all helper scripts and symlinks

`sln <filename>` add a symlink to PATH

`spwd` Add pwd to PATH
